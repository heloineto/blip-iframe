import { Layout } from '@/layout';
import { MDX_DATA } from '@/mdx';

export default Layout(MDX_DATA.sendCommand);

## Usage

The `sendCommand` sends a command through the Blip Commands API using MessagingHubService
(default) or BlipService.

This package already provides a extensive list of type-safe wrappers for the most
common commands, but you can also use the `sendCommand` function directly for any commands that are not covered by the wrappers.

To learn the low level details of how commands are implemented using the LIME protocol, read this article: [limeprotocol.org/index#command](https://limeprotocol.org/index.html#command)

## Example

```ts
import { blip } from 'blip-iframe';

// Gets the current bot's json flow (from builder)
blip
  .sendCommand({
    command: {
      method: 'get',
      uri: '/buckets/blip_portal:builder_published_flow',
    },
  })
  .then((response) => console.log(response.data));

// Gets all the bots (applications) of the current tenant
blip
  .sendCommand({
    command: {
      method: 'get',
      to: 'postmaster@portal.blip.ai',
      uri: '/applications',
    },
  })
  .then((response) => console.log(response.data));
```

## Parameters

The `sendCommand` function accepts the following parameters:

```ts
interface SendCommandParams {
   /**
   * The timeout in milliseconds for the command to be executed
   */
  timeout?: number;
  /**
   * The service that will call the command. MessagingHubService is the default.
   */
  destination?: 'BlipService' | 'MessagingHubService' | (string & {});
  /**
   * Properties of the command to be executed
   */
  command: {
    /**
     * Identifier of the envelope, which can be any relevant value for the caller.
     *
     * If the command is sent through an "asynchronous" protocol (that does not guarantee of delivery order of the envelopes, like LIME),
     * it will be used to link a request to a response.
     */
    id?: string;
    /**
     * Identifier of the sender LIME node, in the name@domain/instance format.
     *
     * If a LIME node receives an envelope without this value,
     * it means that the envelope was originated by the remote party.
     */
    from?: string;
    /**
     * Identifier of the destination LIME node of the envelope,
     * in the name@domain/instance format.
     *
     * If the value is left empty in the request, the command will be processed by the connected node (server).
     *
     * Common values are: 'postmaster@desk.msging.net', 'postmaster@portal.blip.ai' and 'postmaster@tunnel.msging.net'
     */
    to?: string;
    /**
     * Acronym for per procurationem.
     * Identifier of a delegate LIME node (a node that received a permission
     * to send on behalf of another), in the name@domain/instance format.
     *
     * This property is useful to get resources in the server owned by
     * different identities, like presence and account information.
     * The value should be defined if the resource of an observe method
     * command is owned by a different identity than the destination.
     */
    pp?: string;
    /**
     * Allows the transport of generic information, in the "name": "value"
     * format. This property is optional for all envelopes.

     * of the server.

     * Method for the manipulation of the resource. The possible values are:
     * - get - Gets an existing value of the resource.
     * - set - Sets or updates a for the resource.
     * - merge - Merges the resource document with an existing one. If the resource doesn't exists, it is created.
     * - delete - Deletes a value of the resource or the resource itself.
     * - subscribe - Subscribes to the resource, allowing the originator to be notified when the value of the resource changes in the destination.
     * - unsubscribe - Unsubscribes to the resource, signaling to the destination that the originator do not want to receive further notifications about the resource.
     * - observe - Notify the destination about a change in the resource value of the sender. Commands with this method are one-way and the destination should not send a response for it. Because of that, these commands may not have an id.

## Return type

The return type `sendCommand` varies according to the command executed.
If you want type safe access to commands, you can use the commands functions provided by this package.
