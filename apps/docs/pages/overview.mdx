# Overview

The Blip Iframe package provides a set of functionalities and APIs to interact
with the Blip platform.
This overview will introduce you to some of the key concepts and features of
Blip Iframe.

## Why use Blip Iframe?

There are three main ways to make calls to the blip API. They are:

- `iframe-message-proxy`: Can send commands and actions, only works inside the blip platform (iframe context, such as an extension);
- `blip-dsk`: Works inside and outside the Blip platform, requires more configuration to use;
- REST API: Works inside and outside the Blip platform, can only send commands.

The main reasons to use Blip Iframe instead of the other options are:

- **Write less code**: Blip Iframe removes all the boilerplate and makes calls very simple and concise.
- **Type-safe API**: Blip Iframe is written in TypeScript and provides types to
  all the parameters and responses.
- **Documentation on the IDE**: Blip Iframe uses JSDoc for documentation of all the
  functions, parameters and types. You can see the documentation directly
  on your IDE. You won't have to wonder what parameters an request needs,
  and what those parameters are.
- **Error awareness**: Blip Iframe provides a consistent way to handle errors. [Learn more](#handling-errors)

## Actions vs Commands

Actions are functionalities provided by the Blip platform, designed to work
within an iframe inside the Blip platform.
Under the hood, they are invoked using the `blip-iframe-proxy` package and can only be
triggered from within the Blip platform.

Commands, on the other hand, are functionalities that can be created and called
through the Blip API. They can be invoked both inside and outside the Blip platform,
either as REST API calls, Websocket messages (Blip SDK) or as commands within the platform.

Actions are specific to the Blip platform and the iframe context, while commands
provide more flexibility and can be used in various environments.

### Calling an action

```jsx
import { blip } from 'blip-iframe';

async function main() {
  const response = await blip.getApplication();

  if (!response.success) {
    console.log('An error occurred:', response.error);
  } else {
    console.log('Application:', response.data);
  }
}
```

Under the hood, `blip-iframe` will send the 'getApplication' action
using the `iframe-message-proxy` package, and properly type the response.

### Calling a command

```jsx
import { blip } from 'blip-iframe';

async function main() {
  const response = await blip.getAttendants();

  if (!response.success) {
    console.log('An error occurred:', response.error);
  } else {
    console.log('Attendants:', response.data);
  }
}
```

### Calling a custom command

Sometimes you may want to call a command that's not yet available in the
`blip-iframe` package. In this case, you can use the `sendCommand` function
to send a custom command.

```jsx
import { blip } from 'blip-iframe';

async function main() {
  // You can define the type of the response as a type parameter
  const response = await blip.sendCommand<{ example: string }[]>({
    command: {
      method: 'get',
      to: 'postmaster@portal.blip.ai',
      uri: '/example',
    },
  });

  if (!response.success) {
    console.log('An error occurred:', response.error);
  } else {
    console.log('Command response:', response.data);
  }
}
```

## Handling errors

Blip Iframe provides a consistent way to handle errors. All the functions
return a response object with the following structure:

```ts
interface Response<T> {
  success: boolean;
  data?: T;
  error?: Error;
}
```

The `success` property indicates whether the request was successful or not.
If the request was successful, the `data` property will contain the response
data. If the request failed, the `error` property will contain an error object
with information about the error.

The error returned from the Blip API can be a string or something else.
Blip Iframe will parse the error and return an JavaScript `Error` object.
