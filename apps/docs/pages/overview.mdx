# Overview

The Blip Iframe package provides a set of functionalities and APIs to interact
with the Blip platform.
This overview will introduce you to some of the key concepts and features of
Blip Iframe.

## Actions vs Commands

Actions are functionalities provided by the Blip platform, designed to work
within an iframe inside the Blip platform.
Under the hood, they are invoked using the `blip-iframe-proxy` package and can only be
triggered from within the Blip platform.

Commands, on the other hand, are functionalities that can be created and called
through the Blip API. They can be invoked both inside and outside the Blip platform,
either as REST API calls, Websocket messages (Blip SDK) or as commands within the platform.

Actions are specific to the Blip platform and the iframe context, while commands
provide more flexibility and can be used in various environments.

## API Functions

Blip Iframe provides a set of functions that allow you to perform various
actions and interact with the Blip platform. Some of the key functions include:

- `getApplication`: Get details about a bot (application).
- `getCurrentLanguage`: Get the language of the current user account.
- `hideNavbar`: Hide the top navigation bar of the Blip platform.
- `showNavbar`: Show the top navigation bar of the Blip platform.
- `startLoading`: Start showing an overlay loading indicator on the Blip platform.
- `toast`: Show a toast notification on the Blip platform.

These functions provide a convenient and intuitive way to interact with the
Blip platform and perform actions such as retrieving information, customizing
the user interface, and displaying notifications.
